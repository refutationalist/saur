A YML file (jsonrpc2.yml) is required in /var/lib/signal-cli for the
JSON-RPC mode of the REST API to function.  If you change things, you'll
need to change that.   There's a copy of it in /usr/share/signal-rest.

I was never able to get account linking working properly through the REST
API.  Best to sudo into the signal-cli user and use the command line to
link the account.

This is not well tested.
