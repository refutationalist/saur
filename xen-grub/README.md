# Xen pvhgrub -- Arch Linux Implementation

[PVH](https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Xen_Project_Software_Overview#PVH_.28x86.29) is the newest and apparently most secure virtualization method available to Xen. It is basically a PV-like mode based on HVM.   Many of the descriptions of the technology say that only direct kernel boot is currently supported, but this documentation for [Xen 4.12 RC](https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Xen_4.12_RC_test_instructions#PVH_domU_boot_via_grub2) gives instructions for building GRUB2 to boot in PVH mode, allowing the usage of kernels in the PVH domU.

## How to boot Arch under Arch with pvhgrub

First, build and install xen-pvhgrub.

### domU configuration

Basically, you pass pvhgrub as the kernel in a Xen domU.cfg file:

```
name   = "domU"
type   = "pvh"
kernel = "/usr/lib/xen/bin/pvhgrub"
```

And then continue to configure as normal.

## grub.cfg inside the domU

In the ``/boot`` directory of your domU, create a ``grub.cfg`` file:

```
set default=0
set timeout=3

menuentry "Arch Linux" {
  set root=(xen/xvda1)
  linux /boot/vmlinuz-linux root=__ROOT__ rw __OTHEROPTS__
  initrd /boot/initramfs-linux.img
}

menuentry "Arch Linux Fallback" {
  set root=(xen/xvda1)
  linux /boot/vmlinuz-linux __ROOT__ rw __OTHEROPTS__
  initrd /boot/initramfs-linux-fallback.img
}

```

This avoids having to install GRUB2 on the domU, and therefore some complexity.    It might be possible to use the standard GRUB2 configuration options, but I have not tested this and I'm negatively interested in doing so.
